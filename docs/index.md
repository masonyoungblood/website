**Hello!** My name is Dr. Mason Youngblood, and I study animal communication and cultural evolution at the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). My research combines computational methods like machine learning and agent-based modeling to explore how socially learned behaviors change over time and space. In recent years, I've investigated questions such as:

* What are the parallels between human language and animal communication systems like [bird](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0250) and [whale song](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads6014)?
* How do [cultural norms](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.191149) and [community structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513821000556) shape changes in contemporary music?
* What [environmental](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00546-3) and [social factors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02106-x) drive the spread of extremist political ideology?

Beyond research, I'm also a sound artist, music producer, and freelance AI developer. If you'd like to chat, feel free to reach out!
